Now that we have considered the two dimensional case for a folded singularity we can extend it to a third dimension in our system. This can be done by considering a system of one fast and two slow variables \st, 
\begin{equation}
\begin{cases}
\epsilon \dot{x}&=f(x,y,z,y,\epsilon),\\
\dot{y}&=g_1(x,y,z,y,\epsilon),\\
\dot{z}&=g_2(x,y,z,y,\epsilon),
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
which we can see is an extension of our original form - Equation \ref{SlowS}
