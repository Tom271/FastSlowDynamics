Now that we have considered the two dimensional case for a folded singularity we can extend it to a third dimension in our system. This can be done by considering a system of one fast and two slow variables \st, 
\begin{equation}
\begin{cases}
\epsilon \dot{x}&=f(x,y,z,y,\epsilon),\\
\dot{y}&=g_1(x,y,z,y,\epsilon),\\
\dot{z}&=g_2(x,y,z,y,\epsilon),
\end{cases}\label{eq: fs singularity system}
\end{equation}
which we can see is an extension of our original form - Equation \ref{SlowS} \citep{MMO}. Furthermore, \citet{MMO} also discusses that the addition of an extra slow variable causes issues with respect to the existence of a canard solution. This is because our existence ranges increases from $ O(\epsilon) $ to $ O(1) $, noting that $ \epsilon\ll 1 $ \citep{MMO}. Then for this system we are able to make similar assumptions to the previous case, Section \ref{sec:singularities-and-fold-points}, but it is obvious we now must have more than one fold point. We can see that this is the case in Figure \ref{fig: 3d folded singularity},
\begin{figure}[h!]\centering

	\caption{Three dimensional folded singularity.}
	\label{fig: 3d folded singularity}
\end{figure}
as our fold point now can take multiple locations within our system. From here we are able to define some non-degeneracy conditions, much like we did in Section \ref{GSPT},
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
&f(p_*,\lambda,0)=0,\\
&\pd{}{x}f(p_*,\lambda,0)=0,\\
&\pd{^2}{x^2}f(p_*,\lambda,0)\neq 0,\\
&D_{(y,z)}f(p_*,\lambda,0) \ \text{has full rank one},
\end{aligned}
\label{eq: non-degeneracy 3d system}	
\end{equation}
where we denote $ p_*=(x_*,y_*,z_*)\in F $ as our fold points and $ D_{(y,z)} $ as our Jacobian \wrt $ y \ \text{and}\ z $ \citep{MMO}. In addition to this we can see from Figure \ref{fig: 3d folded singularity} that we have some interesting flows within our system. These flows do not follow the standard pattern as we saw in Figure ref{fig: vdp flow diagram}, instead the slow flow switches its orientation when the flow hits the fold point and continue to flow in that direction, as a desingularised flow - these are called isolated singularities \citep{MMO}. %dot in diagram
As a result we are able to express these flows in the following manner, using Equation \ref{eq: non-degeneracy 3d system}, 
\begin{equation}
\begin{cases}
\dot{x}&=g_1\pd{f}{y}+g_2\pd{f}{z}\\
\dot{y}&=-g_1\pd{f}{x},\\
\dot{z}&=-g_2\pd{f}{x},
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
where we can then define a folded singularity if $ g_1(p_*,\lambda,0)\pd{}{y}f(p_*,\lambda,0)+g_2(p_*,\lambda,0)\pd{}{z}f(p_*,\lambda,0)=0 $, for our flow on branches ($ S $) \citep{MMO}. Next we need to consider the stability of our fold points. We do this by constructing the Jacobian of our system, 
\begin{equation}
J=\begin{bmatrix}
\pd{\dot{x}}{x}&\pd{\dot{x}}{y}&\pd{\dot{x}}{z}&\pd{\dot{x}}{\lambda}&\pd{\dot{x}}{\epsilon}\\
\pd{\dot{y}}{x}&\pd{\dot{y}}{y}&\pd{\dot{y}}{z}&\pd{\dot{y}}{\lambda}&\pd{\dot{y}}{\epsilon}\\
\pd{\dot{z}}{x}&\pd{\dot{z}}{y}&\pd{\dot{z}}{z}&\pd{\dot{z}}{\lambda}&\pd{\dot{z}}{\epsilon}\\
\end{bmatrix},
\end{equation}
which we can easily find the eigenvalues, by taking the determinant. The result of this analysis gives that we have three eigenvalues, $ \sigma_i $ for $ i=1,2,3 $ \citep{MMO}. \Wlg we can choose $ \sigma_3=0 $ because we know that at least one of our eigenvalues must be zero to account for our fold point in our system, as the \textbf{Poincar\'e diagram describes}. Then we know from standard stability theory that, at our folded singularity we will have three types of phase portrait in the form of,
\begin{equation}
\begin{cases}
Saddle \ \sigma_1\sigma_2<0: \sigma_i\in\Re,\\
Node \ \sigma_1\sigma_2>0: \sigma_i\in\Re,\\
Focus \ \sigma_1\sigma_2>0: \Im(\sigma_i)\neq 0,
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
where we can note that only our focus will have imaginary parts \citep{MMO}. \citet{MMO} illustrates this in the following Figure, 
\begin{figure}[h!]\centering
	\includegraphics[height=12cm,width=12cm]{Images/foldednodesetc}
	\caption{Phase portraits of our three dimensional system where a) is a folded saddle, b) folded node, c) and d) are desingularised flows \citep{MMO}.}
	\label{fig: folded singularities}
\end{figure}
where we can see the effect of the varying eigenvalues above. A question which is prudent to consider is, why hasn't \citep{MMO} illustrated the singular canard case for a folded focus. This is easily answered as we know that a singular canard is only present if the node or saddle connect our two connecting branches ($ S^r $ and $ S^a $) whereas we find that for the focus \textbf{this is not the case due to its imaginary parts?} \citep{MMO}.
\begin{theorem}[Canards in $ \Re^3 $ \citep{MMO}]\label{thm: canards in R3}
	For slow-fast systems (Equation \ref{eq: fs singularity system}) with $ \epsilon>0 $ sufficiently small the following holds:\begin{itemize} 
		\item  There are no maximal canards generated by a folded focus. For a folded saddle the two singular canards $ \bar{\gamma_{1,2}} $ perturb to maximaal canards $ \gamma_{1,2} $.
		\item  For a folded node let $\mu=\frac{\sigma_w}{\sigma_s} <1$. the singular canard $ \bar{\gamma_{s}} $ (``the strong canard'') always perturbs to a maximal canard $ \gamma_{s} $. If $ \mu^{-1}\not \in \mathbb{N} $, then the singualr canard $ \bar{\gamma_{w}} $ (``weak canard'') also perturbs to a maximal canard. We call $ \gamma_{s} $ and $ \gamma_{w} $ primary canards.
		\item For a folded node suppose k>0 is an integer such that $ 2k+1<\mu^{-1} <2k+3$ and $ \mu^-1\neq 2(k+1) $. Then, in addition to $ \gamma_{s,w} $ there are k other maximal canards, which we call secondary canard.
		\item The primary weak canard of a node undegoes a trancritical bifurcation for odd $ \mu^{-1}\in\mathbb{N} $ and a pitchfork bifurcation for even $ \mu^{-1\in\mathbb{N}} $
	\end{itemize}
	\end{theorem}
From Theorem \ref{thm: canards in R3} we have now defined the existence of a strong and weak eigenvalue \st $ |\sigma_1|>|\sigma_2| \iff |\sigma_s|>|\sigma_w| $. From this theorem we are then able to carry out explicit investigations, as we will see in Section \textbf{Not done yet}
