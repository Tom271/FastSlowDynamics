Now that we have considered the two dimensional case for a folded singularity we can extend it to a third dimension in our system. This can be done by considering a system of one fast and two slow variables \st, 
\begin{equation}
\begin{cases}
\epsilon \dot{x}&=f(x,y,z,y,\epsilon),\\
\dot{y}&=g_1(x,y,z,y,\epsilon),\\
\dot{z}&=g_2(x,y,z,y,\epsilon),
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
which we can see is an extension of our original form - Equation \ref{SlowS} \citep{MMO}. Furthermore, \citet{MMO} also discusses that the addition of an extra slow variable causes issues with respect to the existence of a canard solution. This is because our existence ranges increases from $ O(\epsilon) $ to $ O(1) $, noting that $ \epsilon\ll 1 $ \citep{MMO}. Then for this system we are able to make similar assumptions to the previous case, Section \ref{sec:singularities-and-fold-points}, but it is obvious we now must have more than one fold point. We can see that this is the case in Figure \ref{fig: 3d folded singularity},
\begin{figure}[h!]\centering

\end{figure}
as our fold point now can take multiple locations within our system. From here we are able to define some non-degeneracy conditions, much like we did in Section \ref{intro},
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
&f(p_*,\lambda,0)=0,\\
&\pd{}{x}f(p_*,\lambda,0)=0,\\
&\pd{^2}{x^2}f(p_*,\lambda,0)\neq 0,\\
&D_{(y,z)}f(p_*,\lambda,0) \ \text{has full rank one},
\end{aligned}	
\end{equation}
where we denote $ p_*=(x_*,y_*,z_*)\in F $ as our fold points and $ D_{(y,z)} $ as our Jacobian \wrt $ y \ \text{and}\ z $ \citep{MMO}. In addition to this we can see from Figure \ref{fig: 3d folded singularity} that we have some interesting flows within our system. These flows do not follow the standard pattern as we saw in Figure \ref{fig: vdp flow diagram}
