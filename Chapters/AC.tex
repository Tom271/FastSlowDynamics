Throughout this project we were able to carry out work on the \textit{Interactions Between Fast and Slow Dynamics in Nonlinear Evolution Equations}. From the beginning of the project we worked collaboratively to keep each other up to date on the various areas of mathematics, without diverging significantly from each others area of focus. This resulted in an equal weighting in the work presented in the following project as all authors engaged in healthy debate on what work should be included and the way in which the project is written. However, Kieran continued on the analysis of the canards while Thomas and Jonna moved onto mixed mode oscillations. Although this was the case, all three authors were actively involved in editing and expressing ideas during this divergence of work. Therefore it is reasonable to conclude that equal weighting should be applied to all authors.
