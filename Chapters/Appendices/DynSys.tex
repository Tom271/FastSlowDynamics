In this appendix we state some standard results from dynamical systems theory.
\subsection{Stable Manifold Theorem}
Suppose $\dot{x} = F(x)$ where $x\in \mathbf{R}^n, F\in C^r(\mathbf{R}^n,\mathbf{R}^n)$ and has only hyperbolic fixed points (i.e. in the associated linearised system $\dot{x}=Ax$, $A\in \mathbf{R}^n$ has no eigenvalues $\lambda$ such that $\mathrm{Re}(\lambda)=0$). 
\subsection{Centre Manifold Theorem}
\subsection{Implicit Function Theorem}
\subsection{Hartman Grobman Theorem}
DO we need this?
\subsection{Hopf Bifurcations}
