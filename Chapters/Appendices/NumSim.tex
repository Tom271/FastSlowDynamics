Many figures in this document? were produced using MATLAB, for example: fig +++++++. In this appendix, we will give a brief tutorial on their production. Fast-slow systems like the ones studied here are a classic example of \emph{stiff} ODEs. 
\begin{definition}[Stiffness Ratio]
	Consider $\dot{x} = F(x)$ where $x\in \mathbf{R}^n, F\in C^r(\mathbf{R}^n,\mathbf{R}^n)$. Let 
	$$ z' = Az,\quad A\in \mathbf{R}^{n \times n}  $$
	denote its linearisation. Suppose all the eigenvalues $\lambda_j$  of $A$ have negative real parts. Then the \emph{stiffness ratio}, $\mu$ is defined as
	$$ \mu :=\frac{\max_j(\mathrm{Re}(\lambda_j))}{\min_j(\mathrm{Re}(\lambda_j))} $$
	If $\mu$ is large, the system is called \emph{stiff}.
\end{definition}
If we consider for example the Van der Pol system \ref{eq: Fast System}, its linearisation is
$$ \begin{pmatrix}
x' \\ 
y'
\end{pmatrix}  = \begin{pmatrix}
2x-x^2 & -1 \\ 
\epsilon & 0
\end{pmatrix}  \begin{pmatrix}
x\\y	
\end{pmatrix}  $$
